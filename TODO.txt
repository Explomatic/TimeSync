For UI we need to do this:

--------------------------
Set colors via code for allowing users to change the color scheme of the app:

--------------------------
Style Popups to be nice
--------------------------
Set up ExceptionInterceptor to trigger popup. Setup done. Messages need work.
--------------------------
Set up code to handle Toolkits with timeslots
--------------------------
Set up queue system: "batch job" + some sort of queue. How do we handle errors? How often do we retry until we stop and inform user/throw an error?
Do we start batch job each time app starts? Should we change workflow so TimeManager only save to DB and batch job does synching? Or should there be two ways of synching: "Sync now" and "Enqueue"?

Maybe only start the background process if user explicitly enables it
--------------------------
Synching in general: Should it be done serially or concurrently?
--------------------------
Pre-alpha test: MOMA and ASRA

Alpha test: Get people from office?

Beta test: ?

How do we handle error reporting during testing? Do we need a testcharter/test procedure?
--------------------------
Look into SQLLite which MOMA talked about
